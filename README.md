# TRWebApp

## 2021 Autumn Project for Python Web App

Tasks so far:
- Install python to machine -> done
- Build a basic GUI (web page?)
    - import cgitb https://smallbusiness.chron.com/run-python-webpage-33100.html
    - Install Flask???
- Create webpage with some form of state (when you add items to the page they remain after closing the page)
    - This bit won't be that hard, just need to be able to trigger the script from the html page
-

Notes:
- When running Flask on my machine it is in debug mode (export FLASK_ENV=development)
    - The benefit of doing this is that when you get an error it will show you the stack trace on the webpage
- Using the action="" will send you to the page with that path
    - this means that you
- Now have working page navigation using Flask template between pages
