Tasks so far:
- Install python to machine -> done
- Build a basic GUI (web page?)
    - import cgitb https://smallbusiness.chron.com/run-python-webpage-33100.html
    - Install Flask???
- Create webpage with some form of state (when you add items to the page they remain after closing the page)
    - This bit won't be that hard, just need to be able to trigger the script from the html page
